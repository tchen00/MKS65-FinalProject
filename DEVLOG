2020-01-04
  bernardW : gained repo collaborator access and tested
  alvinY   : created board.c, wrote place mines, and makeboard
  tammyC   : create basic makefile & format DEVLOG

2020-01-06 to 2020-01-10:
  alvinY   : made play.c, added header files, added csv
  bernardW : finished board.c (created Minesweeper struct, finished makeBoard and printBoard) & debugging
  tammyC   : tried to learn SDL (not looking so great)

2020-01-11:
  tammyC   : fixed linking error & update make file, continued to struggle learning SDL
  bernardW : continued to build Minesweeper algorithms into the game: uncover recursive stuff, countneighbors, flagging, yknow

2020-01-12 to 2020-01-15:
  bernardW : finished all the functions for a one-player Minesweeper game, and commited a bazillion times because Windows :(
  alvinY : fixed findPlayer function, now login works!

2020-01-18 to 2020-01-19:
  chenT: learned more about networking, attempted to incorporate into project, fix up coloring in terminal, update README
    - can establish connection but has binary error (?)

2020-01-20 to 2020-01-21:
  all: got a version of blind-minesweeper to work where the client is sending messages to the server to fill up the board 
    - we could not get the clients to talk to each other so this is our attempt at using networking! we also could not figure out how to return the board to the client from the server (had issues with the struct).
    - we did not want to clutter the current repo, so we added a new folder into the repo for networking. 
    - single player minesweeper works successfully (with bugs in findplayer) 
  alvinY: edited networking code & uploaded 
  chenT: update README & DEVLOG
